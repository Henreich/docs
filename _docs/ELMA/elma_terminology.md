### Terminology
Here are some terms which will be used throughout this page.

- Service provider (SP) = A service provider is associated with one or more domains, and participants registered by the provider will only be approved for message exchange within the provider's domain(s).
- Access point provider (APP) = An access point provider operates access points that the SPs can use by making an agreement.
- Agreement = An agreement between an SP and an APP for usage of a specific access point.
- Processes = Standardized, maintained collections of document types used in e-procurement.
- Participants = Organizations that are connected to a specific endpoint. You can think of this as a "contract" between an organization and an SP.
- Access point (AP) = Represents a physical access point service endpoint, accessible through one or several URLs.
- Endpoint = An access point has one or more endpoints represented by a URL and transport profile.
- Certificates = Your PEPPOL AP certificate.
- Domains = Collections of processes used in e-procurement. 
- Document types = Standardized message types belonging to processes, used in communication between APs.
- Transport profile = The transport method to be used. AS4 is an example of a transport profile.
- Identifier = Consists of a set prefix and a organization identifier. e.g. 9908:991825827
- SML (Service Metadata Locator) = A DNS that returns the address of the SMP that holds the metadata of a given PEPPOL receiver. The SML is the only centrally operated component in the PEPPOL transport infrastructure. It is managed by OpenPEPPOL and operates out of Brussels by DG/DIGIT.
